I'm Joel, an aspiring Software Developer currently based in
Tauranga.
I have a passion for technology and problem-solving, and combining those
interests into a career has been a life-long ambition. Although I havenâ€™t
been able to approach it as a career until now, Iâ€™ve been writing code for
15+ years and am particularly comfortable with the .NET ecosystem.
I've recently recovered from a long battle with Chronic Fatigue, and am
highly motivated to enter the software industry, plus make up for some
time lost.

Here is a not-entirely-curated selection of projects from over the last ~5 years. Hopefully they will give an honest glimpse into the type of developer I am (though bear in mind almost all of these were purely personal projects and therefore are light on documentation!). The two pinned projects are more recent, and have a decent explanation of each project in the respective READMEs.

Feel free to reach out with an questions, comments, or advice.
