Kia Ora! I'm Joel, an aspiring Software Developer currently back in study but looking for interesting opportunities.

I have a passion for technology and problem-solving, and combining those
interests into a career has been a life-long ambition. Although I haven’t
been able to approach it as a career until now, I’ve been writing code for
15+ years and am particularly comfortable with the .NET ecosystem.

Here is a not-entirely-curated selection of projects from over the last ~5 years. Hopefully they will give an honest glimpse into the type of developer I am (though bear in mind almost all of these were purely personal projects and therefore are light on documentation!). The two pinned projects are more recent, and have a decent explanation of each project in the respective READMEs.

Feel free to reach out with an questions, comments, or advice.
